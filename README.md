A simple example of the implementation of the Factory Method Design

You can "choose" which ML algorithm to apply to a given dataset

The scope of this example is to illustrate the basic structure for a FMD project, not to actually implement the ML methods.
Adding functionality for the implementation of the ML methods is a work in progress.
